Demo at http://fuelbbpusher.phpfogapp.com/.\r\n\r\nAn example application demoing [Pusher](http://pusher.com) a realtime web API with [FuelPHP](http://fuelphp.com) on the server and [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org) on the client.\r\n\r\n* API endpoint at `/api/messages` implemented in FuelPHP, just for GET and POST requests as the client supports nothing else\r\n* On first load, current messages are 'bootstrapped' into the application to cut down requests\r\n* Backbone provides a seamless UI for creating messages which are added to the list & pushed to the API\r\n* FuelPHP then pushes the message out to all connected clients using Pusher. Each client then adds the new message to their list\r\n\r\nUsing the [FuelPHP Pusher package](https://github.com/lembubintik/pusherapp).\r\n\r\nNotable files include:\r\n\r\n* [Index Controller](https://github.com/danharper/fuelbackbonepusher/blob/master/fuel/app/classes/controller/site.php)\r\n* [Index View](https://github.com/danharper/fuelbackbonepusher/blob/master/fuel/app/views/site/index.php)\r\n* [Messages API Controller](https://github.com/danharper/fuelbackbonepusher/blob/master/fuel/app/classes/controller/api/messages.php)\r\n* [Message Model](https://github.com/danharper/fuelbackbonepusher/blob/master/fuel/app/classes/model/message.php)\r\n* [Message Observer -> Pusher](https://github.com/danharper/fuelbackbonepusher/blob/master/fuel/app/classes/observer/message/created.php)\r\n\r\n* [Client-Side](https://github.com/danharper/fuelbackbonepusher/blob/master/public/assets/js/app.js)","tagline":"Demo of FuelPHP, Backbone.js and Pusher","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
